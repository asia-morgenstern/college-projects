# college-projects
A collection of all the major coding projects I've done in my undergrad CS classes.  

<em>Note:  There is no guarantee that code is correct.  Code uploaded is (for the most part) the code that was turned in.</em>

## Binary Search Tree
Implements a binary search tree for integers using lazy deletion.  Written in C++.

Completed in CS 251 Data Structures (2nd Year Fall) | Project 4

## Bouncy Bouncy
Allows the user to draw a boundary and an inner object.  Object will translate and rotate inside the boundary bouncing and reflecting against the boundary.  Written in C++ with OpenGL.

Completed in CS 441 Computer Graphics (3rd Year Spring) | Project 2 <br/>
Collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/elizabeth-walters">@elizabeth-walters</a>

## Deque Implementation
Creates a linked list implementation of a deque.  Assumes that only integers will be placed on the deque.  Written in C++.

Completed in CS 251 Data Structures (2nd Year Fall) | Project 3

## Genetic Algorithm
Implements a genetic algorithm to solve 3 optimization problems:
<ul>
  <li>Matching randomly generated strings to some target string</li>
  <li>Solving the transcendental equation cos(x) = x</li>
  <li>Finding a root for polynomials and other transcendental equations</li>
</ul>
<em>Note:  This code (including updated versions) can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/asia-morgenstern/genetic-algorithm">genetic-algorithm</a> repo.</em>

Completed in PHY 234 Computational Physics (3rd Year Fall) | Final Project

## Memory Match
Allows the user to play the Memory Match game on a 4x4 grid of cards.  Written in C++ with OpenGL.

Completed in CS 441 Computer Graphics (3rd Year Spring) | Project 1 <br/>
Collaborated with <a href="https://github.com/elizabeth-walters">@elizabeth-walters</a>

## Poker Solitaire
Allows the user to play Poker Solitaire.  Written in Java.

Completed in CS 151 Principles of Computer Science I (1st Year Fall) | Homeworks 8 & 9

## Stack Implementation
Implements a stack.  Checks if all delimiters are properly opened and closed within a given file.  Written in C++.

Completed in CS 251 Data Structures (2nd Year Fall) | Project 2
